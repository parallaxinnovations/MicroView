The application is designed specifically for analysis of CT images of bone. The choice of which functions to perform on a given ROI , can be selected prior to any calculation. The results could be stored or appended in user specified plain text files. The Basic Bone Analysis Application contains the following analysis tools: BMD , which reports the bone mineral density (BMD), bone volume fraction (BVF), bone mineral content, and various other statistics; Stereology , which reports Euler index, bone volume fraction, bone surface to bone volume ratio, trabecular plate thickness, trabecular plate number, trabecular plate separation and various other measures. The Euler index is a measure of the connectivity of a trabecular structure. Tip The commercial package Advanced Bone Analysis Application contains analysis tools for SMI, Anisotropy, and Stereology. It also offers project and study management tools and support PDF and Excel outputs. Using the Basic Bone Analysis Application Activate the Basic Bone Analysis Application by selecting Analyze \u2192 Bone Analysis... from MicroView's menu, or by clicking on the Bone Analysis button in the Applications group of MicroView's toolbar . If an ROI has not already been selected, first activate an ROI plugin and select a ROI. As a convenience, the list of available ROI plugins is displayed in the choice-box in the upper left of the plugin: Choose an ROI tool in the available drop-down list, then hit the Activate button to launch the tool. Once a ROI has been selected, enter a gray-level threshold value, that will be used to discriminate bone from none-bone voxels in the image. Either type in a threshold value in the entry field in the Threshold section or click the Auto Threshold button, to determine a best-guess threshold value automatically. If you would like to verify that the automatically selected value is appropriate, generate a histogram of the image contained within the ROI, then hit the Auto Threshold button on the histogram plot window. In the Bone Parameters section select the type of analysis desired. Click the Advanced Options... button to modify the default settings. The Advanced options will be discussed in more detail later in this section. In the Output File section select the name of the file where the results will be stored. The results are written to a plain text file. These results are presented for review after each successful execution. It is also possible to append the results to an existing text file by checking the Append checkbox button. Click the Run button to perform the analysis. Advanced Options The Advanced Options allows the user to modify the default settings. To display the Advanced Options dialog click the Advanced Options... button. In the Advanced Options dialog there are several tabs: The BMD tab has several variables that can be edited manually. By default the values for Bone ADU (arbitrary density unit) and Water ADU are set to the calibration constants found in the header of the currently loaded image file (not all file types support this). The Lower Exclusion ADU is a gray scale value below which voxels are not included in the bone equivalent mass calculation. Similarly the Upper Exclusion ADU is a Gray scale value above which voxels are not included in the bone equivalent mass calculation. The upper and lower exclusion ADU should be set to exclude air and metal, respectively, in the bone mass calculation. The Stereology tab, has an option to enable verbose output to display additional measures, and an option to enable the purify algorithm. To obtain meaningful results from Stereology, the image should be passed through this purification filter first. The purify algorithm removes spurious unconnected region. After all the modifications to the Advanced Options have been made, click the OK button to close the dialog. Specific Tool Information Bone Composition Measurement Tool Bone Composition This tool performs a virtual biopsy and \"ashing\" to determine bone mineral content non-destructively. Image data derived from the Locus family of CT scanners may be calibrated to standard CT number, measured in Hounsfield Units (HU), and furthermore calibrated to permit determination of equivalent mass of hydroxyappetite. Results are reported as bone mineral fraction (BVF) or bone mineral density (BMD) in units of mg (HyAp)/cm 3 . To use this tool, launch the Advanced Bone Analysis application, define a 3D ROI, then select a threshold that discriminates bone from soft tissue. Prior to hitting the Run button, if required, click the Advanced Options... button to modify the BMD tool settings: Enter a value for Bone ADU Enter a value for Water ADU Enter a value for Lower Exclusion ADU Enter a value for Upper Exclusion ADU Stereology Tool Stereology MicroView can perform a simple stereology analysis of a 3D bone image. The stereology tool measures trabecular structure using similar techniques to those implemented in classical histomorphometry . 2D techniques determine estimates of trabecular thickness, spacing and density. At the same time, trabecular connectivity is quantified by calculating the Euler number for the trabecular structure. Finally, the bone surface area to volume ratio is also calculated. To perform a stereology analysis on a CT image of a bone, launch the Advanced Bone Analysis application, define a 3D ROI, then select a threshold that discriminates bone from soft tissue. Prior to hitting the Run, if required, click the Advanced button to modify the Stereology tool settings: Optionally click on the Enable Purify option to pass the selected image through a purification algorithm, first, before performing the stereology analysis. The purify algorithm removes isolated bony spicules and fills encapsulated marrow spaces. Note: When the purify algorithm is enabled, select a ROI where at least one of the voxels at the boundary of the ROI is equal to or above the threshold (ie. the trabecular bone must intersect the boundaries of the ROI). Passing a clipped image, through the purify filter, which has no boundary voxels equal to or above the threshold will produce a blank image by the filter. Optionally uncheck the Enable verbose output to disable the verbose output.","title":"Bone Analysis Application"},{"location":"bone-app/#basic-bone-analysis-application","text":"","title":"Basic Bone Analysis Application"},{"location":"bone-app/#overview","text":"MicroView's Basic Bone Analysis Application performs a variety of analysis upon a selected region of interest within an image.

Where can I download the latest version of MicroView? The latest version of MicroView can be downloaded here . Q. Where can I get source code for MicroView and instructions on how to build it? The original source code for MicroView was maintained in cvs, then later, in git on Sourceforge . As of 2015, the sourceforge code was archived and development of Microview was moved to Github . Q. Is MicroView available for macOS? Yes. MicroView is supported on recent version of macOS for both 32-bit and 64-bit architectures. Previous generations of MicroView ran on PPC hardware but with the release of 2.5.0+ PPC platforms are no longer supported. Q. How can I automatically threshold a loaded image in MicroView? MicroView can automatically select an optimal threshold value by examining a histogram of pixel values in a user defined region of interest. This value is useful as input to the isosurface, stereology, and volume rendering plugins. To automatically threshold an image, first select a region of interest, using either the ROI plugin or the 7 / 8 keys. Next, generate a histogram of the pixel values within this region of interest by hitting the g key. Finally, click on the Auto Threshold button on the histogram plot window to automatically determine an optimal threshold. MicroView's automatic thresholding is based upon the \"Otsu\" method. Q. Why can't I export to DICOM format? The image export feature gives a list of appropriate file formats, depending on the image depth of the image you've loaded. If, for instance, you have a 16-bit image, only DICOM format will be available. For 8-bit images, different formats will be available, including jpeg, png, gif, etc. To handle the export of 16-bit images to formats such as jpeg, you need to first rescale the images to 8-bit. Under the Process menu, select Image Downsample in order to convert your image from 16-bit to 8-bit, then select Image Export from the File menu. Q. The Bone Analysis application reports \"No BoneHU for image.\" -- What does this mean and how do I fix it? MicroView originally was tightly bound to a number of preclinical CT scanners that generate images in standardized Hounsfield Units . In addition, image headers contained a boneHU field which indicated the measured CT value for a hydroxyapatite mimicking phantom material, called SB3 (Gammex RMI, Middleton, WI), which helps MicroView to calibrate the conversion from Hounsfield units to mg/cm^3 of bone. The boneHU can be manually entered in the bone application by editing the value within MicroView's advanced dialog (Bone Analyis application Advanced Options BMD tab Bone ADU). Q. How do I make movies in MicroView? MicroView has a rudimentary movie making facility , which permits generation of movies. For more complex movie making, there are numerous screen capture applications that can export to e.g. AVI movies. One such utility is CamStudio . Q. Where's the \"Advanced ROI\" tool? This release of MicroView stems from the open-source origins posted on http://microview.sourceforge.net . The so-called \"Advanced ROI\" plugin was a customization provided by GE Healthcare. A replacement plugin with similar functionality is in the works (2014 Q3). As of Q3 2014, MicroView has a replacement plugin, called Advanced ROI Tool with much of the original functionality of the \"Advanced ROI\" tool. advanced_bone_app ...

This is commonly performed so that the two images may be displayed superimposed together (i.e. fused) in a fashion that makes corresponding features easily viewed and identified. MicroView's register tool is designed for manual landmark registration. Manual landmark registration involves picking two sets of homologous landmarks from so-called \"fixed\" and \"moving\" images. A simple sum of least squares fitting algorithm is then used to determine the transformation to map the moving image to the coordinate system of the fixed image based on the landmarks selected. There is an option in this registration tool that allows the user to select the type of transform to be performed. The options are rigid body, similarity, and full affine transformations. Once images are registered they can be visualized through synchronization and/or fusion. For example, an image gathered from a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner provides functional information whereas an image obtained from a computed tomography (CT) scanner provides information regarding the structure and anatomy of the specimen. Synchronization and fusion will correlate the structural and functional information. Using the Register Tool Activate the Register Tool by selecting Plugins \u2192 Register... from MicroView's menu or by clicking on the Register button in the Applications group of MicroView's toolbar. The registration process is divided into the following 3 main steps: Loading Images and Layout Setup Landmark Registration Visualization Notice that a toggle button appears beside the window/level slides when the Register Tool is activated. Click on the button to toggle the control of the window/level slides to the left and right images. Loading Images and Layout Setup Click the Images & Layout tab to activate this page. Using the Fixed Image drop-down selector, choose an image from the list of loaded images. Use the Moving Image drop-down selector to select a second, moving image target. Select the views desired in the Synchronize Image Layouts section and click the Set button to update the display. The view settings can be changed at any time during the registration process. Landmark Registration Landmarks Click on the Register tab to activate this page. The following are typical steps to do landmark registrations: To select landmarks on images, position the cursor over a landmark in either image and then press the Space on the keyboard. Do the same to the other image to find the corresponding landmark. The selected pair of landmarks are shown as orange marks. At the same time, the coordinates of the landmarks are displayed in a row in the table on the left panel, which is highlighted in orange color and begins with a ? mark. These two landmarks can be moved around by moving the mouse to new positions and then pressing the Space . Zoom in on the images if required to fine-tune the locations of the landmarks. Sometimes, it may be easier to locate the corresponding landmarks in a oblique view. Use the 3D view to manipulate the image and get oblique views. To record the pair of landmarks that are selected in previous step, click the Accept button, or press the Enter key. This pair of landmarks will be displayed as red marks to indicate that they are accepted and recorded. The recorded landmarks may not be moved around. However, they can be deleted and replaced by a new pair. Repeat the above two steps to find more pairs of landmarks. There is no upper limit for the number of landmarks that may be selected. However, a minimum of 3 pairs of landmarks must be selected for 2D images and at least 4 pairs of landmarks must be selected for 3D images. Once enough landmarks have been selected a transformation matrix is automatically calculated to register the moving image on left to the fixed image on the right. The initially disabled Transformed View check box becomes enabled. Check the Transformed View check box to switch the moving image to the transformed view. At this stage, it may be sufficient to skip to the visualization section and examine the registration result. If the result is not satisfactory, continue on to the following steps. Select more landmarks to improve the registration. The additional landmarks on the moving image could be picked either in its original view or the transformed view. Switch back and forth between original and transformed views by checking and unchecking the Transformed View check box. Notice the contents of the second (landmark coordinates on the right) and third (distance) columns also change when the view is changed. Examining the distance column in the transformed view could help one to find the pair of landmarks that contribute the largest RMS error for the registration. The RMS value is the root mean square of the distances between each landmark pairs. This value is displayed under the Landmarks table. Landmarks can be reviewed and/or deleted by selecting the corresponding row in the Landmarks table. Click the left mouse button on a row to highlight it. Click the Delete button to delete the highlighted row and the corresponding landmarks on the images. All of the landmarks can be deleted at once by clicking the Delete All button. By default, the rigid-body transform is used for the registration. If the rigid-body transform is not sufficient for the registration, switch to another type of transform by changing the drop-down selection from the Transformation Matrix section: Rigid Body (6 Parameters) is a type of transformation with 6 degrees of freedom (ie. 3 for rotation and 3 for translation). Similarity (7 Parameters) is a type of transformation with 7 degrees of freedom (ie. 3 for rotation, 3 for translation, and 1 for uniform scale). Full Affine (12 Parameters) is a transformation with 12 degrees of freedom (ie. 3 for rotation, 3 for translation, 3 for scale, and 3 for shear). Note that the more parameters the transformation matrix uses, the more landmarks are needed to get a good result. Landmarks may be added or removed after switching the transformation type. Once done, go to the Visualization page to review the registration result. When satisfied, the results can be saved in one, two or all of the following three ways: Landmark tags: save the landmark coordinates by clicking the Save... button in the Landmarks section of the dialog. The landmarks can be loaded at a later time by clicking the Load... button in the Landmarks section. Resampled image: save the transformed (i.e., registered) moving image on the right pane to a file by clicking the Save... button in the Transformed View section. Tri-cubic interpolation is used to resample the transformed image. Transformation matrix: save the transformation matrix by clicking the Save... button in the Transformation Matrix section. This saved transformation can be applied at a later time to the moving image by clicking the Load... button in the Transformation Matrix section. Visualization Click on the Visual tab to activate this page. The visualization tools in this application serve two purposes. One is to visually evaluate the registration result and the other is to help user to correlate the information from the two images, e.g., the structural and functional information. Synchronized View Checking the Synchronized View check box synchronizes the two displayed images. The synchronized interactions on the images include: Gray scale values for both images are displayed when moving the cursor. Synchronized viewing angle. Synchronized zooming and panning. Synchronized slicing through the images (including Page-Up and Page-Down). Synchronized landmarks. Moving the cursor over a point of interest in either the fixed or moving images and then pressing the Space on the keyboard will activate the pair of orange colored landmarks. This feature can be used to do point-by-point comparison for the two registered images. Tip Remember to uncheck the Synchronized View check box before going back to the landmark page and selecting additional landmarks. Fusion Fusion The moving image can be fused on to the fixed image by checking the Fusion View check box. Once the Fusion View check box is checked, additional controls will appear in the dialog. The Min Level and Max Level sliders determine the range of gray scale values that get mapped to colors. The moving image will be transparent outside this range. If the Ramp Opacity option is checked then the opacity of the moving image is ramped exponentially. Otherwise the opacity is constant and is determined by the Opacity slider. There are several different color tables to select from. A color table is a mapping of gray scale values to RGB color values. Tip Synchronized view and fused views are designed to be used for two registered images, or at least two spatially overlapped images in the world-coordinates (the patient space). Trying to synchronize or fuse two spatially unrelated images will result in unexpected behaviors.","title":"Image Registration Application"},{"location":"image-registration/#image-registration-and-fusion-application","text":"","title":"Image Registration and Fusion Application"},{"location":"image-registration/#overview","text":"Image registration is the process of finding a spatial transform that co-aligns two images, such that homologous features in both images (i.e. identical landmarks in the two distinct images) are given the same spatial coordinate.

The following are typical steps to do landmark registrations: To select landmarks on images, position the cursor over a landmark in either image and then press the Space on the keyboard. Do the same to the other image to find the corresponding landmark. The selected pair of landmarks are shown as orange marks. At the same time, the coordinates of the landmarks are displayed in a row in the table on the left panel, which is highlighted in orange color and begins with a ? mark. These two landmarks can be moved around by moving the mouse to new positions and then pressing the Space . Zoom in on the images if required to fine-tune the locations of the landmarks. Sometimes, it may be easier to locate the corresponding landmarks in a oblique view. Use the 3D view to manipulate the image and get oblique views. To record the pair of landmarks that are selected in previous step, click the Accept button, or press the Enter key. This pair of landmarks will be displayed as red marks to indicate that they are accepted and recorded. The recorded landmarks may not be moved around. However, they can be deleted and replaced by a new pair. Repeat the above two steps to find more pairs of landmarks. There is no upper limit for the number of landmarks that may be selected. However, a minimum of 3 pairs of landmarks must be selected for 2D images and at least 4 pairs of landmarks must be selected for 3D images. Once enough landmarks have been selected a transformation matrix is automatically calculated to register the moving image on left to the fixed image on the right. The initially disabled Transformed View check box becomes enabled. Check the Transformed View check box to switch the moving image to the transformed view. At this stage, it may be sufficient to skip to the visualization section and examine the registration result. If the result is not satisfactory, continue on to the following steps. Select more landmarks to improve the registration. The additional landmarks on the moving image could be picked either in its original view or the transformed view. Switch back and forth between original and transformed views by checking and unchecking the Transformed View check box. Notice the contents of the second (landmark coordinates on the right) and third (distance) columns also change when the view is changed. Examining the distance column in the transformed view could help one to find the pair of landmarks that contribute the largest RMS error for the registration. The RMS value is the root mean square of the distances between each landmark pairs. This value is displayed under the Landmarks table. Landmarks can be reviewed and/or deleted by selecting the corresponding row in the Landmarks table. Click the left mouse button on a row to highlight it. Click the Delete button to delete the highlighted row and the corresponding landmarks on the images. All of the landmarks can be deleted at once by clicking the Delete All button. By default, the rigid-body transform is used for the registration. If the rigid-body transform is not sufficient for the registration, switch to another type of transform by changing the drop-down selection from the Transformation Matrix section: Rigid Body (6 Parameters) is a type of transformation with 6 degrees of freedom (ie. 3 for rotation and 3 for translation). Similarity (7 Parameters) is a type of transformation with 7 degrees of freedom (ie. 3 for rotation, 3 for translation, and 1 for uniform scale). Full Affine (12 Parameters) is a transformation with 12 degrees of freedom (ie. 3 for rotation, 3 for translation, 3 for scale, and 3 for shear). Note that the more parameters the transformation matrix uses, the more landmarks are needed to get a good result. Landmarks may be added or removed after switching the transformation type. Once done, go to the Visualization page to review the registration result. When satisfied, the results can be saved in one, two or all of the following three ways: Landmark tags: save the landmark coordinates by clicking the Save... button in the Landmarks section of the dialog. The landmarks can be loaded at a later time by clicking the Load... button in the Landmarks section. Resampled image: save the transformed (i.e., registered) moving image on the right pane to a file by clicking the Save... button in the Transformed View section. Tri-cubic interpolation is used to resample the transformed image. Transformation matrix: save the transformation matrix by clicking the Save... button in the Transformation Matrix section. This saved transformation can be applied at a later time to the moving image by clicking the Load... button in the Transformation Matrix section.","title":"Landmark Registration"},{"location":"image-registration/#visualization","text":"Click on the Visual tab to activate this page.

Overview MicroView supports a number of 2D and 3D file formats, both for image data, as well as surface geometry formats. A distinction is made between reading/writing image data and importing/exporting image data. This distinction is reflected in the entries listed in MicroView's File menu. File reading and writing reads and writes precisely one file per operation (for instance, one might read a vff image, then save it to a different filename in a different format). File import and export operations are used to read and write, respectively, a sequence of 2D images. Image import is useful for loading a sequence of 2D images into a stacked 3D image. Image export is useful for splitting a 3D image up into a sequence of 2D slices. Not all image formats supported in MicroView are available for all tasks: For instance, while exporting a 3D VFF image to a sequence of TIFF images is available, saving a 3D VFF image to TIFF format is not, since there is no 3D TIFF image format defined. MicroView supports images in various bit depths, ranging from 8-bit to 32-bit formats. Not all file formats are available for image writing and image exporting, depending on the limitations of the individual format. Often, it is convenient to downsample image data to 8-bit, in order to maximize the number of file formats available. MicroView supports images with varying numbers of channels in them. Both single channel (e.g. grayscale images) as well as multichannel (e.g. RGBA images) are supported. Currently, multichannel images are exclusively interpreted as RGB images. The complete list of supported file formats is available in Appendix A of this document. Loading an Image Select File \u2192 Open... from MicroView's menu. Enter a filename, or locate a file in the file selector that appears on the screen. Saving an Image Select File \u2192 Save As... from MicroView's menu to save an image. Select the desired output image type in the drop down selector at the bottom of file selector dialog and enter a filename for the new image. Saving a Screen Snapshot Position the mouse over any 2D viewport, or the main 3D viewport, and press the t key to save a snapshot of the viewport to an image file. Select a filename and filetype, then hit OK to save the file. Importing DICOM images MicroView has good support for reading DICOM images from local DICOMDIR-formatted collections (such as those commonly created by imaging tools that export image data to CD-ROM), as well as from loose DICOM image collections. If DICOM data comes with a DICOMDIR index file, simply open this index file in MicroView with the File \u2192 Open menu, then use the data browser window to select one or more image series to load. For other DICOM collections, two options exist for loading data: 1) Images can be imported using MicroView's import tool, and 2) a DICOMDIR index file can be generated for your data collection. The latter method offers some flexibility because the generated DICOMDIR file allows you to browse image data quickly again at a later date without having to reindex images. Importing 2D image slices Note As of 2020-01-08 filename matching template behaviour has changed. Take care to read the following documentation carefully. MicroView is capable of importing a sequence of 2D images, in a variety of common image formats , and assembling them into either a 3D image (with fixed z-slice spacing) or a stack of spatial or temporally related 2D slices. In order to accomplish this, each 2D image file must be named in a sequence that can be described with one or more wildcard characters. In earlier versions of MicroView, the collection of filenames needed to conform to fairly rigid rules: sequencing of filenames needed to be monotonic and could only increase by one digit per file. Newer releases relax this constraint significantly. Select File \u2192 Image Import... from MicroView's menu. Enter a filename template, in the format import-*.png , where \"*\" denotes a wildcard that matches one or more numeric characters . The Browse button to the right of the template filename box can be used to select a file from a file browser. Hit the Examine button to permit MicroView to examine metadata for all images found in the selected folder -- an import template will be automatically generated to match all the images in the selected folder for you. If possible, pixel or voxel spacing values will also be automatically updated. First and last number indices will be updated according to the number of files that match the current template. If needed, adjust the First number and Last number in the appropriate entry boxes to constrain the set of files loaded (e.g. if a subsection of existing files on disk is desired to be loaded). The first and last number are 0-based index numbers into the list of existing files. Enter the spacing between image slices, in millimeters. Finally, press the OK button to import the sequence of images. Note also, hitting the Update button will show a preview of a slice of image data using the current settings: this is most useful when loading raw image data as a check on dimensions and data format. Example If the template specified ends with import-*.png and files import-004.png , import-006.png and import-007.png are present in the specified folder, First number will automatically be set to 0, while Last number will be set to 2. The first and last index numbers control the list of filenames used based on files present on disk so selecting First and Last numbers as 1 and 2, here, would mean only import-006.png and import-007.png would be considered. First and Last numbers are indices into the list of existing files on disk rather than generators of a list of filenames directly. Warning Previous versions of MicroView operated in a slightly different fashion: Assuming a template ending with import-###.png and First and Last indices set to 0 and 2, MicroView would attempt to load files import-0000.png , import-0001.png and import-0002.png . That is, characters marked by '#' would be replaced by a numeric value which starts at First , then monotonically increased until Last is reached. This pattern replacement has nothing to do with files that are actually on disk and is more restrictive than the newer methodology. Importing Raw Images MicroView can also import raw data in a variety of forms. Start by clicking the Raw Image button to display additional image import options. Specify the offset from the beginning of each file to the raw image data (in case an image header is present), the data type, byte ordering (for 16-bit image data) and the dimensions of the raw image data. Note MicroView can also import a single 3D raw image, if the 3D Image checkbox is checked. Instead of entering a sequence of file names, specify the entire filename, and enter x, y and z axis dimensions. Exporting 2D image slices Select File \u2192 Image Export... from MicroView's menu. Choose an image format from the list provided. The list will vary depending on the image depth of the image you are saving. Next, select an output directory to write the image slice sequence into. MicroView will automatically write image slices to filenames with an extension that depends on the file format that you select, and a prefix of \"export-\" (e.g. export-0001.gif , ...).","title":"Reading and Writing Image Files"},{"location":"reading-and-writing-files/#reading-and-writing-image-files","text":"This section describes basic reading and writing methods in MicroView.","title":"Reading and Writing Image Files"},{"location":"reading-and-writing-files/#overview","text":"MicroView supports a number of 2D and 3D file formats, both for image data, as well as surface geometry formats.

Example If the template specified ends with import-*.png and files import-004.png , import-006.png and import-007.png are present in the specified folder, First number will automatically be set to 0, while Last number will be set to 2. The first and last index numbers control the list of filenames used based on files present on disk so selecting First and Last numbers as 1 and 2, here, would mean only import-006.png and import-007.png would be considered. First and Last numbers are indices into the list of existing files on disk rather than generators of a list of filenames directly. Warning Previous versions of MicroView operated in a slightly different fashion: Assuming a template ending with import-###.png and First and Last indices set to 0 and 2, MicroView would attempt to load files import-0000.png , import-0001.png and import-0002.png . That is, characters marked by '#' would be replaced by a numeric value which starts at First , then monotonically increased until Last is reached. This pattern replacement has nothing to do with files that are actually on disk and is more restrictive than the newer methodology.","title":"Importing 2D image slices"},{"location":"reading-and-writing-files/#importing-raw-images","text":"MicroView can also import raw data in a variety of forms.

MicroView has been ported from VTK 4.4 to 5.10, which provides it with a more stable and capable visualization framework. A completely new user interface, based on wxWidgets , has been written which permits the software to be ported to a wide variety of platforms and uses native widgets in place of the custom Motif-style Tkinter widgets used in previous releases. Under the hood, all images are treated as DICOM objects, which facilitates maintaining image meta data between different image formats in a much better fashion. With compatible hardware, MicroView will begin to leverage GPU-acceleration in a variety of places, most visibly with volume rendering. New Features Multi-image support : Multiple images can be loaded into separate viewer tabs in MicroView, simultaneously. Tabs can be arranged on the screen side-by-side to facilitate image comparison and image registration. Tabs can be cloned, to permit side-by-side comparison and analysis of the same image without incurring additional memory overhead. New image formats : MicroView 2.5.0 adds support for Jpeg2000, FITS, Nifti, ISQ, VTK Metafile, BioRad, Drishti, VG Studio Max export format, VOX, WEBP and more. It also radically improves support for DICOM (including DICOMDIR), as well as Analyze, and MINC. A full list of supported file formats can be found in File formats . New filters : MicroView 2.5.0 supports a wider collection of common filters, including: minium, maximum, and median filters. It also includes a variety of static and adaptive thresholding and morphological operators. A simplified scripting interface : Third-party scripts can be writte in python to perform simple tasks. Each script is passed a numpy array linking to the currently selected image and some simple meta data - scripts simply make changes to the image array and return results. New plugins : MicroView 2.5.0 adds a variety of new plugins including: CT Toolbox : A replacement plugin for the original GE CT Calibration tool. This plugin contains a variety of useful tools for CT image analysis. Reconstruct : A basic front-end to the Parallax Innovations GPU reconstruction tools. This plugin allows you to monitor reconstruction progress on reconstruction compute engines. Point-picker : A new plugin that mimics a similar tool in GE's Analysis+ version of MicroView. Useful for recording, measuring and manipulating fiducial markers on an image. Advanced ROI : A replacement plugin for the original GE 'Advanced ROI' tool. This plugin closely mimics the look-and-feel of it's predecessor but lacks some of the more advanced features of the original plugin. Flood-fill Region Grow : A new plugin that mimics GE's original region growing plugin, but with a number of additional features. Camera Info : Shows camera transform info as well as cut plane information. Can load and save both camera and image slice orientation information. Interactive Shell : Perhaps the most powerful tool in MicroView: MicroView 2.5.0 now has an interactive shell, which allows access to loaded images as 3D image arrays. A variety of open-source packages can be directly used on images including Numpy and Scipy . Rescale Image : Use this plugin to apply linear transformations to voxel values in an image. Image Math : Perform simple mathematical operations (e.g. addition, subtraction, multiply, divide) on an image using either scalar constants or pixel-by-pixel operations when provided with a second image. Data Conduit : Import data from IDL\u2122 and Matlab\u2122 datasets. Plugin Improvements : The Standard ROI plugin gains spherical ROI support as well as the ability to rotate ROI primitives. The image information plugin now displays DICOM tags for all image types. The Image transfer plugin has been rewritten to natively support DICOM network transfers, rather than relying on 3 rd party tools. It will automatically detect Osirix workstations as well as the Parallax Image Bank . The plugin also understands a number of other transfer mechanisms, such as a faster web-based transfer mechanism for Orthanc . The Render volume plugin has been rewritten from the ground up, and now supports GPU-accelerated rendering. The Geometry manager has been rewritten to support a larger variety of datatypes. Unstructured grids, vector fields and surfaces can now be viewed, with a wider range of viewing options. The Movie Maker plugin has been rewritten to use the OpenCV library on all platforms. It has been extended to support combining multiple basic sequences together, thus enabling more complicated movie generation. Supported Platforms Windows MicroView is now supported on 32-bit and 64-bit Windows (XP/Vista/Win7/Win8/Win10) platforms. Versions of Windows prior to Windows XP are no longer supported. Linux MicroView is now supported on Centos, Fedora and Ubuntu platforms. Binary installers are available that target each platform's long-term support releases for a minimum of one support cycle. For example, MicroView Ubuntu binaries are currently available for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver) and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS (Xenial Xerus). macOS MicroView is now supported on 64-bit Intel Mac platforms, starting with macOS 10.8.

Overview For many operations in MicroView, the starting point is the selection of a 2D or 3D region of interest (ROI). ROIs define the portion of the volume to be analyzed. For instance, an ROI can be created around a feature in an image in order to compute the mean and standard deviation of just that feature. The active ROI in MicroView is typically displayed in yellow to differentiate it from other surfaces and voxel highlight tools. The ROI may appear as a transparent yellow surface, or as a grouping of yellow voxels in the displayed image plane, depending on the tool used to generate the ROI. Currently, there are six tools that can be used to generate an ROI: The Standard ROI Tool - The 7 and 8 , or alternatively Alt + 7 and Alt + 8 keys can be used to quickly define a rectangular ROI. You can use the \"Standard ROI\" menu button for greater control over the size and location of the ROI. The Histogram Plot Tool - This tool is used to plot histogram values of voxels contained within the active ROI, but can itself be used to select a range of voxels, by graylevel value, to serve as an ROI. The Advanced ROI Tool - This tool is used to define more generic regions of interest. For instance, spline-fitted surfaces can be defined using this tool. This tool also provides a deformable-model based shrink-wrapping application. The Region Grow Tool - Use this tool to define an ROI based on connected voxels with similar gray-level values. Connected voxels can be grouped together using one of three rules: all voxels with gray-level values greater than a user-defined threshold, all voxels with gray level values lower than a user-defined threshold, or all voxels with gray level values within a range of values centered on a user-defined threshold. While used to select an ROI, the tool can itself operate within the confines of a pre-existing ROI, or can be applied to the whole image. The Cortical Bone ROI Tool - When applied to a CT image of a bone, this tool can be used to select an ROI corresponding either to the cortical shell or the internal trabecular space of the bone. The tool uses a series of morphological operators to semi-automatically select cortical bone components. A gray-level threshold value, and two scaling size parameters may be tuned in order to improve the accuracy of this ROI tool. The ROI Manager Tool - This tool replaces and enhances the functionality of the Overlay Geometry tool by enabling MicroView to store and manipulate more than one ROI in memory. File operations, combinations of multiple ROI and manipulation of the display characteristics are possible. Once an ROI has been defined, a number of operations may be performed, including: Image Blanking - Use the Del and Shift + Del to cut voxels inside, or outside of the given ROI, respectively. Select the value to fill in the appropriate region by selecting Process \u2192 ROI Blanking \u2192 Set Background Value from MicroView's menu.

Adding ROI To have the ROI Manager remember the active ROI, click Add Current ROI and provide a name. The name you provided now appears in the ROI Objects list. The active ROI is now managed. To save a ROI to disk, select a ROI from the ROI Objects list and click Save. The ROI Manager uses the VTK Image or vti format to store ROI on disk. The ROI Manager supports loading of VTK Image files that are created using the save functionality above, as well as the file formats previously supported with the Geometry Manager tool, such as VTK . To load a ROI from disk, click Load and locate the appropriate file. To delete a managed ROI, select the ROI from the ROI Objects list and click Delete. Click Delete All to remove all ROI from the list. Displaying ROI Displaying a ROI does not make a ROI active. That is, displayed ROI do not affect any of MicroView's plugins or the calculations that they perform. To activate a ROI, see the next section \"Activating ROI\". To display a managed ROI, select a ROI in the ROI Objects list. Now click Show. You can display multiple ROI simultaneously. To remove the ROI from the display, click Hide. You have several options to control the visual presentation of the ROI. To view all displayed ROI as binary masks, choose the Mask option. To view the displayed ROI as 3D objects, choose the \"Geometry\" option. The Display Characteristics tab contains options that control the presentation of individual ROI. If you are using the \"Geometry\" display option, then select \"Display Wireframe\" to view a wireframe mesh of the ROI or de-select to view the ROI as a solid object. The \"Surface color\" and \"Surface Opacity\" fields control the colour and translucency of the ROI respectively. When viewing ROI using the \"Geometry\" option, the colour and opacity of each ROI can be controlled independently. When viewing ROI using the \"Mask\" option, the colour of each ROI may be controlled independently, but the opacity affects all of the ROI currently viewed simultaneously. Activating ROI The active ROI affects MicroView's plugins. To activate a ROI, select its name in the ROI Objects list and click Activate. Only one ROI can be active. The \"Active ROI\" field at the top of the ROI manager displays the name of the active ROI. Creating a new ROI supplants the active ROI.

Overview By default, the MicroView display consists of an application toolbar on the far left side of the screen, and one or more viewer windows contained within a notebook on the right side of the screen. Each viewer window contains a 3D image viewport in the center-left of the window, and a column of three 2D viewports on the right side of each window. MicroView also contains a menu at the top of the application window, Window and Level adjustment scrollbars at the bottom and status and progress indicators at the extreme bottom of the window. It contains image-specific tools in the upper right corner of each notebook page and context-sensitive menus in a variety of locations. Finally, it contains an interaction palette just above the status bar, that contains buttons to toggle the behavior of mouse clicks and mouse motion in MicroView. Modifying the Layout Viewports Each viewport in MicroView can be individually maximized by double-clicking the left mouse button over the viewport. When in the maximized state, the display can be restored by double-clicking the left mouse button while continuing to position the mouse over the viewport. The display of individual viewports can be managed by selecting the appropriate entries under the Window menu as well ( Window \u2192 Layout ). The basic layout of MicroView can also be changed: Select Window \u2192 Layout \u2192 Set Layout to 2-by-2 to display MicroView as a 2-by-2 grid of viewports. Select Window \u2192 Layout \u2192 Set Layout to 1-by-3 to switch back to the default arrangement. Tabs and Notebooks Generally speaking, a majority of the layout features of MicroView are customizable by click-and-dragging them from one place on the screen to another. Toolbar All of MicroView's analysis tools are available through pull down menus. The most commonly used tools and applications are also available in the toolbar on the tab named \"Tools & Apps\", at the left hand side of the main window. Whenever a tool is launched, a new tabbed window will appear in the toolbar. Interaction Palette MicroView's Interaction Palette contains convenient buttons that change the default mode of mouse interaction with the application. By default, left (or primary) mouse clicks and drags within the 3D and 2D viewports changes the orientation of the image on the screen. By clicking on the appropriate button in the palette, this behavior can be changed to one of a number of other modes. Each mode can be additionally accessed by either a different mouse button, or combining Shift and/or Ctrl with a mouse button, as described below . Using the Interaction Palette is particularly convenient in one or two mouse button environments. Window and Level Controls A common task, when viewing images with greater dynamic range than the capabilities of the viewing workstation, is the adjustment of image brightness and contrast. MicroView allows adjustment of grayscale image brightness by defining either an image's window and level setting, or by defining the minimum and maximum grayscale values to display. Window and Level scrollbars are positioned at the bottom right side of MicroView's main window, and can be interactively adjusted. The actual window and level values will be displayed in the statusbar at the very bottom right corner of MicroView.

Volume Rendering Tool Overview Note MicroView 2.5.0 features GPU-acceleration and improved level of detail rendering for most volume rendering functions. MicroView's volume rendering tool can be used to produce stunning photo-realistic 2D semi-transparent representations of 3D image data by one of three raycast techniques. Raycast volume rendering is especially common in the medical imaging community where three dimensional volume data is easily available. To understand raycasting, think of voxels within a 3D image as possessing a density which corresponds to the graylevel value of the voxel. Imagine that for each pixel in the rendered image scene, a ray is drawn from the observer's eye, through the image pixel, then through the entire 3D image data set. Each ray will intersect a number of voxels before leaving the 3D image data. For each image pixel in the rendered scene, a color is determined by accumulating information derived from the intersecting voxels along the corresponding raycast ray. In particular, for each voxel in the 3D image data, the \"density\" or graylevel value of the voxel will be transformed into a corresponding voxel color and transparency. This color and transparency information will be combined, according to a raycast function to determine the final pixel color in the image scene. MicroView currently supports three styles of raycast volume rendering: Isosurface Rendering - a raycast method where surfaces of similar density objects are rendered, and the remaining materials are hidden. For this rendering mode, a density threshold value must be selected that defines the surface, and the color of the surface selected. Maximum Intensity Rendering - a method where the color of the densest object along each raycast path is used to determine the final color of each pixel. This method is particularly useful to extract, e.g. contrast-enhanced vessels, or bone from images. Composite Rendering - a general raycast method, which gives the greatest level of control over the raycast scene. MicroView's Rendering Interface MicroView's volume rendering interface allows the user to control the type of rendering to generate and the parameters that will be used to generate the rendering. The interface consists of the following elements. A graphical view that presents the image histogram, the opacity and color ramp and a representation of the LUT. The view can be controlled in the same fashion as the histogram or 2D profile plot windows. Additionally, this view contains a number of control points connected by a line. These control points are represented by either a blue (inactive) or red (active) dot and can be manipulated as outlined below. Control Point Settings group. These controls allow the user to fine tune the specific values that are used for each control point in the opacity and color ramp. A drop down box that contains a number of rendering presets. These presets have been designed to produce a good quality rendering in specific circumstances. There are two presents currently. Bone - sets the threshold at the Bone HU value specified in the volume. Soft tissue/Bone - uses the composite rendering method to generate an image that will accurately represent both soft tissues and bones. The preset values have been chosen using the calibrated HU values for bone and soft tissues. A pair of drop down boxes that are used to select the rendering mode to use, and the quality of the rendering to generate. The low quality rendering can be used to rapidly evaluate whether the chosen parameters will generate the desired image or not as the rendering is produced much more rapidly. Once the parameters have been roughly determined, the high quality rendering can be used to fine tune the results. A group of buttons that provide the following functionality: Save - saves all of the parameter settings to file for use at a later time or on another system. Load - loads the parameter settings from a file generated using the Save function above. Reset - Resets the histogram view and all of the associated parameters to the default values for the selected rendering function. Isosurface - the threshold value is set in the middle of the grayscale range of the volume. Maximum Intensity Projection - three regions equally spaced in the grayscale range of the volume. The first region covers the smallest values and has an opacity of 0. The second region covers the middle third of the values and is a ramp from an opacity of 0 to an opacity of 1. The final region covers the highest values and has an opacity of 1. Composite - a ramp starting from the smallest grayscale value in the volume and an opacity of 0 to the largest grayscale value in the volume and an opacity of 1. There is a third control point at the middle grayscale value. The interface is reset whenever a new image is loaded into MicroView. Update: generate the volume rendering using the current settings. Manipulating the volume (rotation, slicing, magnification) has the same effect. Using the Volume Renderer Tool Select Visualize \u2192 Render Volume... from the MicroView menu to open the volume rendering tool window. Select the style of volume rendering desired. Composite rendering offers the greatest control over the display, but is the slowest form of rendering. MIP rendering displays a maximum intensity projection of the currently loaded image data. Isosurface rendering displays only the surface of objects, and is most useful for rendering bone images. Change the location of the controls points if desired, to achieve the appropriate rendering result. The control points are chosen using the left mouse button and will change from blue to red to indicate that they are active. Isosurface - there are two control points that are vertically connected. These control points represent a threshold. All of the values above the threshold will be rendered. The two control points are always at the same graylevel. Maximum Intensity Projection - there are four control points, of which two can be manipulated by changing the graylevel value where they are located. The opacity values are fixed for all of the control points. The two end points are fixed. The first end point is at the lowest graylevel value in the volume and has an opacity of 0. The second end point is at the highest graylevel value in the volume and has an opacity of 1. The two control points in the middle of the histogram can be moved back and forth to change their graylevel position, and thus the location and slope of the ramp function. Composite - the composite rendering function is the most complicated and begins with three control points (two end points and the mid-point) and a ramp function from an opacity of 0 to an opacity of 1 as outlined above. The end points are fixed at the appropriate graylevel positions, but can have their opacity changed. There are a number of different manipulations that can be performed on the control points. Adding a control point - move the mouse pointer over the line that does not have an existing control point and click the left mouse button. A new point will appear at that location and will be active as indicated by the red coloration. Deleting a control point - select any existing control point by clicking on it with the left mouse button. The point will be marked active using the red coloration. Delete the point by pressing the \"Del\" key on your keyboard. Changing the opacity - select any existing control point by clicking on it with the left mouse button. By holding the left mouse button, it is possible to drag the control point up and down in the graphical view to change its opacity value. It is also possible to change the opacity of the currently selected control point by typing a value into the Opacity text entry box. Changing the graylevel position - select any existing control point by clicking on it with the left mouse button. By holding the left mouse button, it is possible to drag the control point left and right in the graphical view to changes is graylevel position. It is also possible to change the graylevel position of the currently selected control point by typing a value into the Position text entry box. Change the color that each surface will appear by using the color editor. Begin by selecting any control point by clicking on it with the left mouse button and noting that its color changes from blue to red. The color can then be edited using either the sliders on the color bars or by entering a value in the appropriate text entry box. How the color change is applied depends on the type of rendering that is being generated. Isosurface - all pixels above the specified threshold will be colored using the selected color. Maximum Intensity Projection - the pixels above the active control point will be colored using the selected color and the ramp function that joins the active control point to the next larger graylevel control point. Composite - same color treatment as the Maximum Intensity Project noted above. Select quality of rendering. Choose \"low\" quality to render rapid, lower quality images. These low quality renderings can be used to quickly evaluate the results of any changes that are made to the parameters before generating the more time consuming high quality renderings. Choose \"high\" quality once opacity, and color tables have been correctly set, in order to render at the highest quality. Click the Update button to update the output display whenever the rendering parameters have been adjusted. Manipulating the image by rotation, slicing or magnification will cause the output display to be updated. Click the Reset button to restore the opacity and color transfer functions to their original default values. Use the Save and Load buttons to save and load the parameter settings. Use the \"Enable volume picking\" checkbox to enable or disable volume picking: When enabled, the middle mouse button can be used to interactively adjust cropping dimensions that will be applied to the rendered image. When disabled, picking is disabled and MicroView will not allow the rendered volume to intercept mouse clicks and drags. Additional MicroView Tools MicroView has a number of additional features bundled into application plugins. Some of the core plugins are described below. Reorient Image As discussed in earlier sections of this help guide, MicroView can perform arbitrary axis multiplanar reformatting of 3-D image data. Reorienting the displayed image planes is performed on-the-fly without actually adjusting the underlying image. To actually save the image reformatted along new axes, a specific image reorient tool in MicroView is used. To save a reoriented image, first center and orient the cut planes in the 3-D view pane to represent the axes of the desired output image. Once satisfied with the displayed axes, select File \u2192 Save Reoriented Image... to save the reoriented image to a file. Standard ROI Tool Note MicroView 2.5.0 features spherical ROI objects as well as the ability to rotate primitives. MicroView's ROI tool can be used to select a 2D or 3D region of interest in the image for further analysis. It compliments the manual ROI selection technique, using the 7 and 8 keys. Use this tool when a ROI of a specific size or position is needed. Activate the ROI tool by selecting Standard ROI from the Tools and Applications sidebar on the left hand side of the main window, or by selecting Tools \u2192 Standard ROI... from the main menu. Choose Parallelepiped, Elliptical Cylinder or Spherical ROI shapes for the selected analysis region (Box, Cylinder and Sphere options, respectively). Choose a unit of measurement -- either millimeters or pixels. Adjust the size and position of the selected analysis region: Either manually enter coordinate values into the appropriate text boxes (hit enter key to accept changes), or adjust the sliders to the right of each entry box to choose the bounds of the region of interest. Alternatively, you can resize and reposition a rectangular ROI by interacting with the faces of the yellow box in the main 3D viewport. Position the mouse over any surface, then click and drag the middle mousebutton to resize the ROI along the axis parallel with the ROI face you clicked upon. Holding the shift key down, while performing the same operation will translate the ROI along the same axis. Press the Link X/Y button to enable or disable linking size changes in X and Y axis. Check the Link Image Plane radio button to enable rotation of ROI primitives. Rotate image planes in order to take advantage of this feature. Advanced ROI Tool Advanced ROI Tool is used to generate a 3D region of interest (ROI) from a series of stacked 2D ROIs. The purpose of this tool is to allow the user to manually select an arbitrary ROI. Once an advanced ROI is selected, analysis such as calculating mean and standard deviation, generating an isosurface, and calculating BMD can be performed. Activate the Advanced ROI Tool by clicking on the Advanced ROI button on the Tools and Applications sidebar or by selecting Tools \u2192 Advanced ROI... from the main menu. Choose one of the four options ( Rectangle , Ellipse , Polygon and Spline ) for the shape of the 2D ROIs. Click the Start button to begin drawing on the 2D image of your choice. At any time, click the Reset button to delete all 2D and 3D ROIs. This action may not be undone. If Rectangle or Ellipse is chosen, position the mouse on the 2D image, press the left mouse button and drag the mouse. To adjust the size of the 2D ROI place the mouse on the upper left corner or bottom right corner of the 2D ROI, press the left mouse button and drag the mouse. Release the left mouse button when the proper size is reached. To adjust the position of the 2D ROI place the mouse on the bottom left corner or top right corner of the 2D ROI, press the left mouse button and drag the mouse. Release the left mouse button when the 2D ROI is positioned properly. Click the left mouse button outside of the 2D ROI to re-select and inside of the 2D ROI to drag it around. Push the plane with middle mouse button and start to draw another 2D ROI. If Polygon or Spline is chosen, we enter free-hand mode. Click the left mouse button on the 2D image to choose points. The points will be connected automatically with line segments. To close up the ROI circle, click on the first point. To delete a point, select that point by clicking on it with the left mouse button the delete key. After you 2D ROI is closed, it can be edited by dragging a point to re-position it, clicking on a line segment to add a point, clicking inside the ROI to drag the whole ROI, or clicking outside of the ROI to erase the ROI and start all over. When using a Polygon geometry, the contract and shrink-wrapping operations are available. Shrink wrapping fits the current 2D ROI to features in the image. To use the shrink-wrapping operation, first, create a 2D ROI in Polygon mode, next, click Shrink-Wrap. If the resultant 2D ROI is undesirable, delete some points and try again. You can fine-tune several parameters that affect the shrink-wrapping operation. Click Advanced Options... to access these options. - Tension - the rigidity of the 2D ROI. Increase for a more rigid 2D ROI. Decrease for a smoother 2D ROI. - Edge Attraction - the strength of the attraction that the edges in the image have on the 2D ROI. Increase to speed up the calculation. Decrease to enhance accuracy. Increasing too much will cause the 2D ROI to become attracted to distant features. - Resolution - the number of nodes to place per 10 pixels. Increase for greater accuracy. Decrease to speed up the calculation. - Blur Radius - the Gaussian kernel used to calculate image force. Increase for larger capture radius. Decrease for greater accuracy. The automatic option causes MicroView to base the radius on the size of the 2D ROI: a larger 2D ROI results in a larger blur radius. The manual option causes MicroView to use the value entered. When using the manual option, increasing too much will cause the 2D ROI to become attracted to distant features. - No. Of Frames - described in the next section. Defaults restores default values; Cancel exits without making any changes; and OK exits effecting the changes. Contract is another way to fit a contour to the features in the image. In this case, the 2D polygon outline is drawn outside of the object to surrond, and the polygon shrinks until a preset threshold value is reached. You can fine-tune several parameters that affect the shrink-wrapping operation. Click Advanced Options... to access these options. - Resolution - the number of nodes to place per 10 pixels. Increase for greater accuracy. Decrease to speed up the calculation. - Threshold - the threshold value, in calibrated units, that represents the object being segmented. 2D ROI can be extruded from one frame to another. To directly copy the current 2D ROI to another frame, select the linear radio button in the Active-Contour Tools panel. To incrementally fit the 2D ROI using the shrink-wrapping operation described above, select the shrink-wrap radio button. Note that shrink-wrapped extrustions can only be performed in the Polygon mode. Now click Extrude . One can specify the extrustion distance either graphically or by entering a positive or negative number of millimeters. When shrink-wrap is selected, the extrusion is performed using the shrink-wrapping operation incrementally. To contol the number of frames between shrink-warpping, click Advanced Options... and modify the No. Of Frames field. Increase for faster execution. Decrease for more accuracy. Increasing this parameter too much may actually increase execution time: the more the incremental slices differ, the longer the calculation will take to converge. Note that for each user-drawn 2D ROI there is a number in the Key Frames section. This number indicates the image slice index where the 2D ROI was drawn. Click the Interpolate Contours button to generate 2D ROIs on every empty slice between the minimum and maximum Key Frames. There are two options for the interpolation: Linear or Spline. After the interpolation, one can edit any frames to fine-tune the ROIs. Every edited frame will become a Key Frame in addition to the existing Key Frames. Clicking on the Interpolate button the do the interpolation again using the updated Key Frames. At any time, click the Save Contours button to save the stack of 2D ROIs. Later, the stack of 2D ROIs can be loaded by clicking the Load Contours button. To generate a 3D ROI from a stack of 2D ROIs and display the 3D ROI, navigate to the 3D ROI tab and click the Generate 3D ROI button. Click on the ROI On or Off Radio button to show or hide the 3D ROI. Press the Save... button the save the 3D ROI, which can be used in future by the Manage Geometries . Click the X button in the top right hand side of the notebook tab to close this tab and remove ROIs from all image panes. This action may not be undone. Cortical Bone ROI Tool When applied to a CT image of a bone, this tool can be used to select a ROI corresponding to either the cortical shell or the trabecular space of the bone. The tool uses a series of morphological operators to semi-automatically select cortical bone components. The trabecular space is found within the cortical bone region. Once the cortical bone components have been selected, they can be converted to a ROI for use in the Advanced Bone Application and the image planes can be rotated so that the axes of the planes are aligned with the principal axes of the cortical bone. Before running this tool, the user needs to either select a ROI to be used for segmentation, or the tool will automatically select the entire image and perform segmentation on the resulting ROI. Activate the ROI tool by selecting Cortical ROI from the Tools and Applications sidebar on the left hand side of the main window, or by selecting Tools \u2192 Cortical ROI... from the main menu. The gray-level threshold may be either entered manually or determined automatically by using the Auto Threshold button. The result of automatic thresholding is determined using the \"Otsu\" method The \"Hole and Channel Size\" specifies the largest size, in pixels, of any holes and channels through the bone that you would like the algorithm to fill. The default value is 7 pixels. The \"Trabecular thickness\" specifies the largest size, in pixels, or trabeculae that you would like the algorithm to remove from the ROI. For bones where the cortical thickness is similar to the trabecular thickness, the segmentation algorithm may also eliminate the cortical bone making it less suitable for use in these circumstances. The default value is 7 pixels. Use the Run button to segment the cortical bone contained in the ROI. Use the Segmentation \u2192 Cortical ROI button to convert the segmentation results (highlighted in green) to a ROI (highlighted in yellow) that can be used for analysis operations in the Advanced Bone Application. Select the Segmentation \u2192 Trabecular ROI button to invert the ROI selection -- i.e. select the trabecular bone region as a ROI. Use the Align to Principal Axes button to rotate the axis planes to be aligned with the principal axes of the segmented cortical bone Isosurface Tool MicroView's isosurface tool can be used to extract a surface from a 3D image that corresponds to a user-defined gray-level value. Activate the tool by selecting Visualize \u2192 Isosurface... from the main menu. To use the tool: Select an image threshold value in the Image Threshold text box. Select a quality factor using the Surface Quality Factor slider. This factor is used to downsample the image prior, to extracting an isosurface. Use a small value (e.g. 0.25) initially to extract a course surface, then refine the surface by increasing the factor to 1.0. The memory consumed by this plugin increases quickly for large surface quality settings, as does the size of the final surface mesh. Use large values sparingly. Select a decimation factor by adjusting the appropriate slider. MicroView will attempt to reduce the surface complexity of the final isosurface by this user-defined amount. Setting a value of \"0.1\" means that MicroView will attempt to reduce the surface polygon count by 10%, while minimizing the impacting on surface topology, surface area and volume contained within the isosurface. A value of \"0\" indicates that no decimation shall be attempted, while values approaching \"1\" will significantly impact the quality of the final surface. Optionally enable image smoothing and image clipping by checking the appropriate checkboxes. If smoothing is enabled, MicroView will perform a Gaussian blur on the image prior to generating an isosurface. This is used commonly to reduce image noise, and hence remove spurious surface elements from the final surface. This will have an impact on the accuracy of the Area and Volume measurements displayed in the plugin GUI. Press the Update button to display/update the isosurface. Press the Clear to hide the surface. Image Resample Tool MicroView's Resample Image plugin can perform image resampling on a loaded image. Image resampling changes the dimensions of the image and can both increase or decrease image size. The resample factor may be specified as either a single number, in which case image resampling is done isotropically, or as a list of numbers, in which case MicroView resamples the image differently for each dimension. A typical use for this plugin is to isotropically downsample images so that memory and disk storage are reduced. To activate the plugin, select Process \u2192 Resample Image... from the main menu. Then: Enter a downsampling factor (or factors) in the edit field. Press the Resample and Save... button to resample the image and save it to disk. Image Transfer Tool MicroView can transfer a loaded image to a compatible DICOM viewing station. It can also browse and download into memory images from a number of remote viewing platforms. Certain stations can be automatically detected, while others must be manually configured. Note MicroView requires Zeroconf to automatically detect image servers on your network. This software is automatically available on macOS computers, and is bundled with the MicroView installer software on Windows computers. For Linux computers, MicroView communicates with the \"Avahi\" daemon through a compatability library. Make sure that dnssd_compat is installed (e.g. on Ubuntu, run sudo apt get libavahi-compat-libdnssd1 ) To activate the tool, select Tools \u2192 Dicom Transfer... from the main menu. Enter the hostname and port number of the destination server in the appropriate text entry boxes. Optionally select a DICOM application name, for servers that require communication from a specific application name. For servers that do not require a specific application name, leave this field blank. Check with your DICOM vendor, or user's manual to determine what the AE title should be. Enter values for Patient Name, Patient ID, Study ID and Study Description, if needed. In some cases MicroView may be able to provide default values based on the image loaded. Finally, hit the Send Image button to transfer the image. Manage Geometries Note MicroView 2.5.0 features an overhauled interface for handling point, surface and vector data. General purpose unstructured grids and vector fields can now be displayed in MicroView. Greater control over viewing options have also been added. This tool is used to display and manipulate 3D surface geometry objects. Surface geometries can be read from a variety of common 3D file formats , such as STL, PLOT3D and PLY formats. Loaded geometries may be superimposed on top of the current 3D image data. Surface characteristics, such as color, opacity, and whether the object is displayed as a closed surface or a wire mesh can be adjusted for each loaded surface. Finally, each surface may be selected and assigned as the default ROI for MicroView. This permits advanced ROI selections to be saved and restored, as well as allowing third-party tools to be used to generate ROI objects. Activate the \"Manage Geometries...\" plugin by selecting Visualize \u2192 Manage Geometries... from the main menu. Click the Load button to select a geometry file to load in. Multiple files can be loaded sequentially. Each surface object filename will be displayed in the list box above the Load button. Click the Show or Hide button to show or hide a selected geometry. Click the Delete button to remove a selected geometry from memory. Click the Geometry \u2192 ROI button to assign the currently selected surface as the default ROI for MicroView. Customize the color of a selected surface by clicking on the surface's color button, and adjust surface characteristics of the selected surface by checking or unchecking the Display Wireframe button. Customize the opacity of the selected surface by adjusting the opacity slider. A value of zero means the surface is completely transparent (e.g. invisible), while a value of 1.0 indicates the surface is completely opaque. Image Information Note MicroView 2.5.0 has fundamentally changed how image data is represented internally. These changes facilitate converting data between different image formats, while maintaining meta-info in DICOM-compatible format. See the \"DCM\" page for DICOM-related information. Overview This plugin displays properties about the currently loaded image and general display settings of MicroView, such as background colour, active units etc. The tool can be activated by selecting Tools \u2192 Image Information... from MicroView's main menu. Image and system properties can be viewed in one of two basic property display modes: a general mode presents as much information as possible in loosely defined categories; a DICOM-specific mode presents DICOM tags (or equivalents) for the image. Property Display Modes To view general image properties and viewing options, select the column-like icon at the top of the plugin. To view instead DICOM tags associated with this image, select the DCM icon. The third icon (a silhouette with minus sign) can be used to anonymize DICOM tags associated with the image. Property Filters Image properties can be filtered by adding filter terms in the search box at the bottom of the plugin. Filter words are case insensitive and apply to both property name and property value in both general and DICOM property display modes. You can filter on more than one search string by separating them by spaces. General Information Some fields are specific to vff format images, especially those generated by the Locus reconstruction software package: Air and water parameters, for instance, correspond to calibration values entered using the CT calibration tool in MicroView's CT Toolbox plugin. Similarly, the bone parameter value (measured in Hounsfield Units), is also a calibration value, determined as part of the Locus image reconstruction process. Some image information values (title, subject, air, water and bone values) may be edited by clicking on the value field in the image information box. Press the Enter key to accept the new value, or press the Esc key to cancel your edit session. Editing values in this way does not modify the contents of the original image file on disk -- you must explicitly save the image in order to preserve your changes. Slab Project The Slab Project tool accumulates images from a collection of image slices surrounding the currently image planes and displays them using one of a variety of different functions: minimum, maximum, mean and sum. The tool can operate on either on a finite slab of images or the entire collection of data. It can produce oblique, so-called 'Live View' images, or produce a new static image as it's output. Note This tool serves as a replacement for the 'MIP Image' tool found in older versions of MicroView. Using Slab Project Activate the Slab Project plugin by selecting Visualize \u2192 Slab Project... from the main menu. To enable slab projection, choose 'Oblique Live View', 'X-', 'Y-' or 'Z-' axis projections. The first option will produce output in currently selected 3D viewport, while the remaining three options will generate a new output window. Select an accumulation function: 'Min', 'Max', 'Mean' or 'Sum'. Click the Apply button to generate the slab projection. For 'Live View' mode, interacting with the 3D viewport slice position will change the appearance of the slab. Select File \u2192 Save Snapshot... to save a snapshot of the slab image. Snapshot images are always 8-bit images, and take advantage of the current window/level settings in the slab project window. CT Toolbox The CT Toolbox plugin consists of a collection of tools, useful for day-to-day analysis of CT image data. The plugin can be used to: perform Hounsfield image calibration of GE preclinical scanner data perform image unwarp and bright/dark field corrections remove rings interactively from a 3D CT dataset determine modulation transfer function (MTF) for an imaging system using a standard \"slanted-edge\" test. Note This plugin is designed to supersede the original CT Calibration Tool plugin, found in earlier releases of MicroView. This plugin allows the user to measure three different ROI's within an image, and save/restore these values. The purpose of saving three sets of ROIs is so that the reconstruction software can automatically determine air, water and bone calibration constants. Activate the CT Toolbox plugin by selecting Tools \u2192 CT Toolbox... from the main menu. Define a ROI with only air by using either the 7 / 8 keys,or by selecting a ROI using the ROI plugin ( Plugins \u2192 ROI Selection Tool... on the MicroView menu) and click the corresponding Save button. Similarly do the same for water and bone. Once the ROI's for air, water, and bone have been selected and the settings have been saved, click one of the Load buttons and the corresponding ROI will appear. Make Movie Note The Movie Maker plugin now uses OpenCV to generate movies in a variety of different output formats. The specific codec list available is platform dependent. This plugin allows the user to make a movie of a sequence of screen snapshots, while the loaded image is either rotated 360 degrees about an axis, or sliced along a cutplane. Sequences can be accumulated together to build more complex movies. Individual orientations can also be controlled by using stationary snapshots. Select Visualize \u2192 Make Movie... to load the movie maker. Next: Select the type of animation desired in the Animation Type drop-down menu. The X/Y/Z Rotation entries correspond to animations of the image scene while rotating the image about the selected axis. The X/Y/Z Slicing entries generate an animation of the image scene while slicing through the entire image along the selected image axis. Select from one of a number of movie file types. Enter the number of snapshot images to take while generating a movie sequence. For rotation-type movies, this number will determine how many degrees to rotate the image scene between each image and the next. Press the Add sequence button to start the movie making process. For the first sequence only, you will be prompted to select an output filename. Additional sequences can be added to the movie by repeating the above steps until the entire movie is produced. Finally, close and finish generating the movie by clicking the Finish button. Point Picker MicroView's point picker tool is used to make a set of landmark measurements on an image, and to save these measurements to disk. Start the tool by selecting Plugins \u2192 Point Picker... from the main menu. Once loaded: Position the mouse cursor over a point of interest in either 3D or 2D viewports Press the Space key to place a marker at the current mouse position Press the Accept button, or Enter key, to permanently accept the marker position, or reposition the mouse and hit the Space key again to move the marker For each marker, the 3D coordinate will be recorded in the table contained in the measurement tool. Additional column space reserved for adding comments to each line Press the Save... button to save the current marker positions to disk Captions for each landmark can be optionally displayed floating beside each landmark Additional support for the display of a rectangular-shaped ROI about each landmark is available Interactive Shell From MicroView's interactive shell, images can be interrogated and manipulated easily. The toplevel python variable images is a list of images, indexed by each loaded images tab number, which is displayed on each image's Viewer tab. Data Conduit The Data Conduit plugin allows loading image data from select IDL\u2122 and Matlab\u2122 data files. The plugin requires additional software to operate and will prompt and download the add-on software the first time it is used. Rescale Image MicroView's Rescale Image plugin performs simple linear transformations on pixel values, that is, it can transform pixels by an offset and scale factor. The plugin can be useful, for instance, in converting CT image data into Hounsfield units. Reconstruct Reconstruct. Flood-fill Region Grow Flood-fill region grow. Image Math The Image Math plugin can be used to perform simple binary operations on a loaded image. At a minimum, one image must be selected in the Image #1 dropdown choicebox. Depending on the selected operation, the second dropbown choice box can be used to either select a constant value or a second image. The plugin generates an output image, rather than overwriting it's input arguments, and the name of this output image can be selected in the Output \u2192 Name text box. Camera Info The Camera and Transformation Info plugin displays information about MicroView's 3D viewport. The Camera section displays info about position and orientation of the viewer within the 3D image scene. The Image section provides information about how the 3D image is being sliced and transformed. The orientation information can be saved and reloaded into MicroView, which allows scene layouts to be saved and restored at a later time.","title":"Tools and Plugins"},{"location":"tools-and-plugins/#tools-and-plugins","text":"This section describes the various extension plugins which are available for MicroView.","title":"Tools and Plugins"},{"location":"tools-and-plugins/#volume-rendering-tool","text":"","title":"Volume Rendering Tool"},{"location":"tools-and-plugins/#overview","text":"Note MicroView 2.5.0 features GPU-acceleration and improved level of detail rendering for most volume rendering functions. MicroView's volume rendering tool can be used to produce stunning photo-realistic 2D semi-transparent representations of 3D image data by one of three raycast techniques. Raycast volume rendering is especially common in the medical imaging community where three dimensional volume data is easily available. To understand raycasting, think of voxels within a 3D image as possessing a density which corresponds to the graylevel value of the voxel. Imagine that for each pixel in the rendered image scene, a ray is drawn from the observer's eye, through the image pixel, then through the entire 3D image data set. Each ray will intersect a number of voxels before leaving the 3D image data. For each image pixel in the rendered scene, a color is determined by accumulating information derived from the intersecting voxels along the corresponding raycast ray. In particular, for each voxel in the 3D image data, the \"density\" or graylevel value of the voxel will be transformed into a corresponding voxel color and transparency. This color and transparency information will be combined, according to a raycast function to determine the final pixel color in the image scene. MicroView currently supports three styles of raycast volume rendering: Isosurface Rendering - a raycast method where surfaces of similar density objects are rendered, and the remaining materials are hidden. For this rendering mode, a density threshold value must be selected that defines the surface, and the color of the surface selected. Maximum Intensity Rendering - a method where the color of the densest object along each raycast path is used to determine the final color of each pixel. This method is particularly useful to extract, e.g. contrast-enhanced vessels, or bone from images. Composite Rendering - a general raycast method, which gives the greatest level of control over the raycast scene.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"tools-and-plugins/#microviews-rendering-interface","text":"MicroView's volume rendering interface allows the user to control the type of rendering to generate and the parameters that will be used to generate the rendering. The interface consists of the following elements. A graphical view that presents the image histogram, the opacity and color ramp and a representation of the LUT. The view can be controlled in the same fashion as the histogram or 2D profile plot windows. Additionally, this view contains a number of control points connected by a line. These control points are represented by either a blue (inactive) or red (active) dot and can be manipulated as outlined below. Control Point Settings group. These controls allow the user to fine tune the specific values that are used for each control point in the opacity and color ramp. A drop down box that contains a number of rendering presets. These presets have been designed to produce a good quality rendering in specific circumstances. There are two presents currently. Bone - sets the threshold at the Bone HU value specified in the volume. Soft tissue/Bone - uses the composite rendering method to generate an image that will accurately represent both soft tissues and bones. The preset values have been chosen using the calibrated HU values for bone and soft tissues. A pair of drop down boxes that are used to select the rendering mode to use, and the quality of the rendering to generate. The low quality rendering can be used to rapidly evaluate whether the chosen parameters will generate the desired image or not as the rendering is produced much more rapidly. Once the parameters have been roughly determined, the high quality rendering can be used to fine tune the results. A group of buttons that provide the following functionality: Save - saves all of the parameter settings to file for use at a later time or on another system. Load - loads the parameter settings from a file generated using the Save function above. Reset - Resets the histogram view and all of the associated parameters to the default values for the selected rendering function. Isosurface - the threshold value is set in the middle of the grayscale range of the volume. Maximum Intensity Projection - three regions equally spaced in the grayscale range of the volume. The first region covers the smallest values and has an opacity of 0. The second region covers the middle third of the values and is a ramp from an opacity of 0 to an opacity of 1. The final region covers the highest values and has an opacity of 1. Composite - a ramp starting from the smallest grayscale value in the volume and an opacity of 0 to the largest grayscale value in the volume and an opacity of 1. There is a third control point at the middle grayscale value. The interface is reset whenever a new image is loaded into MicroView. Update: generate the volume rendering using the current settings.

Select the style of volume rendering desired. Composite rendering offers the greatest control over the display, but is the slowest form of rendering. MIP rendering displays a maximum intensity projection of the currently loaded image data. Isosurface rendering displays only the surface of objects, and is most useful for rendering bone images. Change the location of the controls points if desired, to achieve the appropriate rendering result. The control points are chosen using the left mouse button and will change from blue to red to indicate that they are active. Isosurface - there are two control points that are vertically connected. These control points represent a threshold. All of the values above the threshold will be rendered. The two control points are always at the same graylevel. Maximum Intensity Projection - there are four control points, of which two can be manipulated by changing the graylevel value where they are located. The opacity values are fixed for all of the control points. The two end points are fixed. The first end point is at the lowest graylevel value in the volume and has an opacity of 0. The second end point is at the highest graylevel value in the volume and has an opacity of 1. The two control points in the middle of the histogram can be moved back and forth to change their graylevel position, and thus the location and slope of the ramp function. Composite - the composite rendering function is the most complicated and begins with three control points (two end points and the mid-point) and a ramp function from an opacity of 0 to an opacity of 1 as outlined above. The end points are fixed at the appropriate graylevel positions, but can have their opacity changed. There are a number of different manipulations that can be performed on the control points. Adding a control point - move the mouse pointer over the line that does not have an existing control point and click the left mouse button. A new point will appear at that location and will be active as indicated by the red coloration. Deleting a control point - select any existing control point by clicking on it with the left mouse button. The point will be marked active using the red coloration. Delete the point by pressing the \"Del\" key on your keyboard. Changing the opacity - select any existing control point by clicking on it with the left mouse button. By holding the left mouse button, it is possible to drag the control point up and down in the graphical view to change its opacity value. It is also possible to change the opacity of the currently selected control point by typing a value into the Opacity text entry box. Changing the graylevel position - select any existing control point by clicking on it with the left mouse button. By holding the left mouse button, it is possible to drag the control point left and right in the graphical view to changes is graylevel position. It is also possible to change the graylevel position of the currently selected control point by typing a value into the Position text entry box. Change the color that each surface will appear by using the color editor. Begin by selecting any control point by clicking on it with the left mouse button and noting that its color changes from blue to red. The color can then be edited using either the sliders on the color bars or by entering a value in the appropriate text entry box. How the color change is applied depends on the type of rendering that is being generated. Isosurface - all pixels above the specified threshold will be colored using the selected color. Maximum Intensity Projection - the pixels above the active control point will be colored using the selected color and the ramp function that joins the active control point to the next larger graylevel control point. Composite - same color treatment as the Maximum Intensity Project noted above. Select quality of rendering. Choose \"low\" quality to render rapid, lower quality images. These low quality renderings can be used to quickly evaluate the results of any changes that are made to the parameters before generating the more time consuming high quality renderings. Choose \"high\" quality once opacity, and color tables have been correctly set, in order to render at the highest quality.

To use the shrink-wrapping operation, first, create a 2D ROI in Polygon mode, next, click Shrink-Wrap. If the resultant 2D ROI is undesirable, delete some points and try again. You can fine-tune several parameters that affect the shrink-wrapping operation. Click Advanced Options... to access these options. - Tension - the rigidity of the 2D ROI. Increase for a more rigid 2D ROI. Decrease for a smoother 2D ROI. - Edge Attraction - the strength of the attraction that the edges in the image have on the 2D ROI. Increase to speed up the calculation. Decrease to enhance accuracy. Increasing too much will cause the 2D ROI to become attracted to distant features. - Resolution - the number of nodes to place per 10 pixels. Increase for greater accuracy. Decrease to speed up the calculation. - Blur Radius - the Gaussian kernel used to calculate image force. Increase for larger capture radius. Decrease for greater accuracy. The automatic option causes MicroView to base the radius on the size of the 2D ROI: a larger 2D ROI results in a larger blur radius. The manual option causes MicroView to use the value entered. When using the manual option, increasing too much will cause the 2D ROI to become attracted to distant features. - No. Of Frames - described in the next section. Defaults restores default values; Cancel exits without making any changes; and OK exits effecting the changes. Contract is another way to fit a contour to the features in the image. In this case, the 2D polygon outline is drawn outside of the object to surrond, and the polygon shrinks until a preset threshold value is reached. You can fine-tune several parameters that affect the shrink-wrapping operation. Click Advanced Options... to access these options. - Resolution - the number of nodes to place per 10 pixels. Increase for greater accuracy. Decrease to speed up the calculation. - Threshold - the threshold value, in calibrated units, that represents the object being segmented. 2D ROI can be extruded from one frame to another. To directly copy the current 2D ROI to another frame, select the linear radio button in the Active-Contour Tools panel. To incrementally fit the 2D ROI using the shrink-wrapping operation described above, select the shrink-wrap radio button. Note that shrink-wrapped extrustions can only be performed in the Polygon mode. Now click Extrude . One can specify the extrustion distance either graphically or by entering a positive or negative number of millimeters. When shrink-wrap is selected, the extrusion is performed using the shrink-wrapping operation incrementally. To contol the number of frames between shrink-warpping, click Advanced Options... and modify the No. Of Frames field. Increase for faster execution. Decrease for more accuracy. Increasing this parameter too much may actually increase execution time: the more the incremental slices differ, the longer the calculation will take to converge. Note that for each user-drawn 2D ROI there is a number in the Key Frames section. This number indicates the image slice index where the 2D ROI was drawn. Click the Interpolate Contours button to generate 2D ROIs on every empty slice between the minimum and maximum Key Frames. There are two options for the interpolation: Linear or Spline. After the interpolation, one can edit any frames to fine-tune the ROIs. Every edited frame will become a Key Frame in addition to the existing Key Frames. Clicking on the Interpolate button the do the interpolation again using the updated Key Frames. At any time, click the Save Contours button to save the stack of 2D ROIs. Later, the stack of 2D ROIs can be loaded by clicking the Load Contours button. To generate a 3D ROI from a stack of 2D ROIs and display the 3D ROI, navigate to the 3D ROI tab and click the Generate 3D ROI button. Click on the ROI On or Off Radio button to show or hide the 3D ROI. Press the Save... button the save the 3D ROI, which can be used in future by the Manage Geometries .

The tool uses a series of morphological operators to semi-automatically select cortical bone components. The trabecular space is found within the cortical bone region. Once the cortical bone components have been selected, they can be converted to a ROI for use in the Advanced Bone Application and the image planes can be rotated so that the axes of the planes are aligned with the principal axes of the cortical bone. Before running this tool, the user needs to either select a ROI to be used for segmentation, or the tool will automatically select the entire image and perform segmentation on the resulting ROI. Activate the ROI tool by selecting Cortical ROI from the Tools and Applications sidebar on the left hand side of the main window, or by selecting Tools \u2192 Cortical ROI... from the main menu. The gray-level threshold may be either entered manually or determined automatically by using the Auto Threshold button. The result of automatic thresholding is determined using the \"Otsu\" method The \"Hole and Channel Size\" specifies the largest size, in pixels, of any holes and channels through the bone that you would like the algorithm to fill. The default value is 7 pixels. The \"Trabecular thickness\" specifies the largest size, in pixels, or trabeculae that you would like the algorithm to remove from the ROI. For bones where the cortical thickness is similar to the trabecular thickness, the segmentation algorithm may also eliminate the cortical bone making it less suitable for use in these circumstances. The default value is 7 pixels. Use the Run button to segment the cortical bone contained in the ROI. Use the Segmentation \u2192 Cortical ROI button to convert the segmentation results (highlighted in green) to a ROI (highlighted in yellow) that can be used for analysis operations in the Advanced Bone Application.

Activate the tool by selecting Visualize \u2192 Isosurface... from the main menu. To use the tool: Select an image threshold value in the Image Threshold text box. Select a quality factor using the Surface Quality Factor slider. This factor is used to downsample the image prior, to extracting an isosurface. Use a small value (e.g. 0.25) initially to extract a course surface, then refine the surface by increasing the factor to 1.0. The memory consumed by this plugin increases quickly for large surface quality settings, as does the size of the final surface mesh. Use large values sparingly. Select a decimation factor by adjusting the appropriate slider. MicroView will attempt to reduce the surface complexity of the final isosurface by this user-defined amount. Setting a value of \"0.1\" means that MicroView will attempt to reduce the surface polygon count by 10%, while minimizing the impacting on surface topology, surface area and volume contained within the isosurface. A value of \"0\" indicates that no decimation shall be attempted, while values approaching \"1\" will significantly impact the quality of the final surface. Optionally enable image smoothing and image clipping by checking the appropriate checkboxes. If smoothing is enabled, MicroView will perform a Gaussian blur on the image prior to generating an isosurface. This is used commonly to reduce image noise, and hence remove spurious surface elements from the final surface.

Header files are simple ascii text files, that contain a set of name-value pairs, separated by a colon, one pair per line of the file. An example header file is listed below: width : 336 height : 283 numFrames : 160 shear_angle ( rad ): 0.000000 xVoxelSize : 0.1 yVoxelSize : 0.1 zVoxelSize : 0.2 dataType : 4 This header file describes a 336x283x160 raw image with voxels that are 0.1mm x 0.1mm x 0.2mm in dimension. The shear_angle(rad) entry should be present in the header, but is ignored by MicroView -- it can safely be set to zero. The dataType entry defines the numeric type of the data contained within the raw image file, rawimage.img . The value should be selected from the table below: Image Datatype codes Function Description 2 Signed 8-bit char 3 Unsigned 8-bit char 4 Signed 16-bit short integer 5 Unsigned 16-bit short integer 8 Signed long integer 9 Unsigned long integer 10 Floating-point data Given a raw image for import, first rename the file to have an extension of \".img\". Determine the image dimensions, voxel size and image format. Using the text editor of your choice, create a corresponding header file with the same base name, but an \".nfo\" extension. Copy and edit the entries listed Example 1 into this file, customize to match your image and save. Load MicroView and select the \".nfo\" for reading.","title":"Appendix C - MicroView's support for Raw image data"},{"location":"dev/plugin-architecture/","text":"Plugin Architecture Introduction MicroView supports two extension mechanisms for running third-party code: plugins and scripts .

While MicroView's plugin architecture is more powerful, and gives fine-grain control over the application, it has a steeper learning curve. For simple tasks, MicroView's scripting interface is sufficient. Directories and Files On application startup, MicroView looks for scripts by searching for python *.py files under the Scripts folder in it's application settings folder. The application settings folder can be found by selecting Help \u2192 Open User directory from MicroView's menu. The actual folder location will vary depending on your platform. In the figure, below, the script folder is show for a Windows 10 computer. test1.py will be examined on application startup to see if it is a valid script. Anatomy of a MicroView Script File The contents of test1.py are shown below: import logging logger = logging . getLogger ( __name__ ) def zero_image ( image , origin , spacing , dicom_info ): \"\"\" replace image values with zero \"\"\" image [:] = 0 def flip_image ( image , origin , spacing , dicom_info ): \"\"\" flip image in x-axis \"\"\" image [:] = image [:, :: - 1 ] logger . info ( \"flipped image in x axis\" ) def print_dicom_header ( image , origin , spacing , dicom_info ): \"\"\" print image dicom header \"\"\" logger . info ( \"DICOM info: {} \" . format ( str ( dicom_info ))) zero_image . __menu__ = 'Fill image with zeros' flip_image . __menu__ = 'Flip image in x-axis' print_dicom_header . __menu__ = 'Show image DICOM header' print_dicom_header . __requires__ = [ 'BeautifulSoup' ] This script file contains three entry-point functions: zero_img() , flip_image() and print_dicom_header() all with the same argument list ( image , origin , spacing , dicom_info ). In order for MicroView to call a script function, it must have this calling syntax. Arguments image : contains the currently-selected image as a numpy array. origin : the (x,y,z) origin of the image, measured in mm spacing : the image voxel spacing (x,y,z), measured in mm dicom_info: a pydicom compatible dictionary representing the image meta-info in DICOM format. If the original image data was DICOM this will be a verbatim copy, otherwise a DICOM header is interpolated for the image Note: The image array is a shared copy of the current image in MicroView: modifications to the image array modify the image in MicroView directly. Meta-info At the bottom of test1.py are four static lines that may seem a little odd. The first three attach a static attribute named __menu__ to each function. MicroView searches for this attribute before deciding if a function should be displayed from the Scripts menu. The final line provides a python list of required packages in order for the given function to be run. For instance, in test1.py above, print_dicom_header() is a simple script that prints DICOM header values to MicroView's central logging window - but it claims to require additional python software (BeautifulSoup in this case) before the plugin can be run. This last attribute provides a rudimentary way for MicroView to bootstrap additional software dependencies using python's pip installer.","title":"Scripting"},{"location":"dev/scripting/#scripting","text":"","title":"Scripting"},{"location":"dev/scripting/#introduction","text":"MicroView supports two extension mechanisms for running third-party code: plugins and scripts .
